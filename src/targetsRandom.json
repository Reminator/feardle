"harry - Harry Angel, played by Mickey Rourke, is the protagonist in 1987s “Angel Heart”, which also stars Robert De Niro. There is a scene where De Niro's character spills salt on a restaurant table and Angel takes a pinch and throws it over his left shoulder. One theory for this superstition dates back to Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper. In the painting, Judas is depicted to having knocked over salt. The Bible says Judas betrayed Jesus and so people associated knocking over salt with inviting the Devil to tempt you to do evil deeds. Throwing the salt over your left shoulder (where the Devil lurks) would blind the Devil (or evil Angel) and stop them. The Devil must be so salty.",
"buffy - “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” (1992) is a light horror comedy written and created by Joss Whedon. Whedon was ultimately unhappy with the film due to having to modify the story to be lighter. In 1997 he created the “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” TV series in which he used his original script as a basis for.",
"lynch - David Lynch is an American filmmaker, painter, visual artist, actor, musician, writer, and philanthropist. He rose to fame after his first feature length film “Eraserhead” (1977). Ever the artist, personally approved DVD releases of his movies do not have any chapter stops. This is done because he believes that films are meant to be viewed from beginning to end.",
"horde - A horde of zombies can scale a tall wall in 2013s “World War Z”; a talent kept in the video game of the same name, released in 2019. The movie was based on Max Brooks' novel “World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War”. Brooks has commented that he knew that the movie adaptation was going to be different from his novel and was prepared to hate it because of the differences. After watching it he found that he actually liked it because it was different from his novel. He felt that since he didn't have creative ownership of the characters, he didn't have anything to be mad about. He probably also was not mad at the horde of money he got.",
"chant - Creepy and ominous chants are staples to folk horror. An eerie culty chant can be heard early on in “Rosemary's Baby” (1968). At one point in the film Rosemary, played by Mia Farrow, is reading “Yes I Can”, Sammy Davis Jr's autobiography. Some people say this was included due to Farrow being married to Frank Sinatra at the time; Sinatra and Davis were members of the Rat Pack. However, others say it was an intentional symbolism; Davis Jr. was a member of the Church of Satan during the time the film came out. The church's appeal to him was its focus on unbridled naturism and hedonism; in particuar, the pleasures of the flesh. He eventually left it when a church orgy got out of hand. Rumor has it that he chanted “Yes I Can!” as he ran away.",
"acidy - Vincent Price meets an acidy death in 1959s “House on Haunted Hill”. The film is known for it's gimmicky beginning in which spooky sound effects were played throughout the theater as a scare tactic. The effect was so successful that it started the idea of novelty “haunting records” of which are commonly used during Halloween parties and haunted house attractions.",
