[
"knife - In 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974), Gunnar Hansen, the actor who plays Leatherface, actually slices Marilyn Burns' finger with a knife in the dinner scene. This was out of frustration as the blood tube kept clogging during several takes.",
"cults - Real life cults often inspire horror films; such as 2015s 'The Invitation'. The movie takes inspiration from the cult, Peoples Temple, led by Jim Jones.",
"jason - Happy Friday the 13th!",
"chase - 'The Shining' (1980) was one of the first movies to use Steadicam. Most notably used in the hedge maze chase scene at the film's climatic end.",
"bones - Speaking of bones - Linda Blair fractured her lower spine while filming 'The Exorcist' (1973). She was injured by the mechanical rig attached to the bed she was thrown around in. We watch this in the movie because everybody thought it was just great acting!",
"licks - Freddie Kruger's tongue almost licks Nancy during the famous 'Tongue Telephone' scene in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (1984). The actress who played Nancy reportedly asked to take the tongue prop home after shooting.",
"dream - The premise of the film 'It Follows' (2014) is based on the director's recurring dream in which he was being followed. Keir Gilchrist, who starred in the film, has said that the director wanted the film to feel like a bad dream that never ends.",
"craft - As in 'The Craft' (1996). Director Andrew Fleming followed the guidelines for a PG-13 rating, but a bunch of old crotchety men decided to give it an R rating because it contained teenage girls using witchcraft. Rude!",
"motel - There was once a real life Bate's Motel people could stay in along the CA-99 near Washington state. A huge horror nerd renamed his motel to Bate's Motel and would regularly put on costume parties. Unfortunately the motel was torn down in April of 2012. The hotel sign however remains intact.",
"hexed - In 1990s 'The Witches', the lead protagonist is hexed by the Grand High Witch, turning into a mouse. The scene occurs in a ballroom full of witches, many of whom were actually men in dresses. Who knew!?",
"scare - Love it or hate it, the 'Jump Scare' is a common trope in horror movies. Film historians say the first use of it is in 'Cat People' (1942) during the bus stop scene in which Alice is being stalked by Irena. Me-ow!",
"chord - The 'Jump Scare' is often accompanied by the 'Scare Chord'- a sudden and sharp sforzando of dissonance or sheer noise intended to jolt the audience. One notable use was at the end of 1980s 'Friday the 13th' when Jason's rotting corpse suddenly jumps out of the water and grabs final girl Alice. Yikes!",
"candy - Not including the 2021 'requel', 1992s 'Candyman' is the only horror movie to feature a black serial killer as it's villain.",
"cobra - 'Cult of the Cobra' (1955) was often shown after 'Revenge of the Creature' (1955) as a double creature feature in theaters. Looks like Mr. Gillman was in good cobra-ny!",
"groan - Zombies moan and groan. To portray realistic cannabalistic zombies in 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968), the filmakers had the zombie actors eating ham covered in chocolate syrup. Bone apple tee?",
"death - Death is inevitable both in life and horror movies. To this day, Vincent Price has the most on screen deaths out of any actor in a horror movie. He always paid the ultimate Price!",
"price - Happy Birthday to The Master of Horror, Vincent Price!",
"crate - From cursed objects to a live(undead?) vampire, crates often contain important plot devices in horror movies. In 1948s 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein', the comedic duo are in charge of a crate that contains Count Dracula, played by the late Bela Lugosi. Though Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula is arguably the most iconic, this movie marks the second and last time he plays Dracula.",
"jesse - Mark Patton plays protagonist Jesse Walsh in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge' (1985). This is the only film in the franchise in which the final girl is played by a male. Patton is considered the first male 'Scream Queen' for his portrayal of Jesse. Not that gender matters anymore!",
"ghost - One of the ghost occupants in '13 Ghosts' (1960) is a lion. This lion would go on to portray the Addams' house pet, Kitty Kat, in 'The Addams Family' (1964) TV show. I guess they got a lion's share of the spotlight!",
"bleed - Wesley Snipes plays the titular character in 1998s 'Blade'. In the movie, Deacon Frost bleeds Blade to complete a ritual that would turn himself into a vampire god. Apparently Jet Li was offered the role of Deacon Frost, but turned it down to do 'Lethal Weapon 4' (1998). I guess he didn't think the role in 'Blade' was 'the one'.",
"cliff - One of the most memorable scenes in Midsommar (2019) was the Ättestupa; the scene depicts two elders of Harga leaping off a cliff in ritual suicide, marking the end of their lifecycle. Ättestupa is a name given to several cliffs in Sweden, Norway and Iceland. According to folklore, these were sites of ritual senicide.",
"dimly - Dimly lit spaces are a staple to horror movies. Filmmakers utilize low key lighting to achieve this. Though in modern times this lighting technique is used in horror, thillers and dramas, low key lighting was a defining element of the 'noir' films of the '40s and '50s. It was used to achieve high contrasts between light and dark; in art it is called the 'chiaroscuro effect'. Bet you didn't know this was 'low key' an art lesson!",
"rabbi - In Jewish folklore, a rabbi, Judah Loew ben Bezalel, creates a golem to protect the Jewish people from antisemites; this story is depicted in the silent horror film 'The Golem' (1915). Some believe Mary Shelley borrowed elements from this folklore for her 1818 novel 'Frankenstein'.",
"donny - Donny Beals is one of the kids enchanted by antagonist Andre Linoge in Stephen King's miniseries, 'Storm of the Century' (1999). Actor Colm Feore, who plays Linoge, took it upon himself to befriend all the child actors so that they wouldn't actually be scared of him. How nice of him to try and Colm the kids!",
"final - Horror nerds are familiar with the word 'final'. 'Final girl', 'The Final Chapter' (even though it isn't), 'Final Destination' (even though it isn't). But have you heard of 'The Final' (2010)? The plot revolves around a group of high school outcasts who are being bullied. They decide to get revenge on the bullies by giving them their just desserts... in gruesome fashion. Talk about dulce 'dead' leche!",
"sense - We all know what happens to Bruce Willis' character at the end of M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' (1999). But did you know that Willis was contractually obligated to do the movie? After shutting down production of 'The Broadway Brawler' by firing the director, Willis owed Disney two movies. 'The Sixth Sense' was the first, and 'The Kid' (2000) was the second.",
"leper - Leper refers to someone affected with leprosy, but it also can mean an outcast of society. Many horror antagonists are lepers, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are bad; they just want to be loved!",
"cheek - Hannibal Lecter's first act of cannibalism was that of consuming a butcher's cheek. He attacked the butcher for insulting his adoptive mother, Lady Murasaki. The biting of the cheek would later become Hannibal's signature attack. It's best not to make a 'tongue in cheek' remark to Hannibal!",
"breed - Clive Barker's 'Nightbreed' (1990) was not well received when it released, but has gained a cult following over the years. Barker has said that the studio butchered the film in the editing room and tried to market it as a standard slasher, and has expressed wanting to find the original reels to release his version. Barker was able find the original material and in 2014 released the 'Barker Cut'.",
"fiery - Carrie, played by Sissy Spacek, brings her school down in fiery fury in 'Carrie' (1976). The hand that we see at the end of the film is actually Specek's hand. The director, Brian De Palma, insisted on getting a double, but Spacek maintained that she had to be the one to do it. When setting up the scene, de Palma was uncomfortable about burying her so he had her husband do it. Till death do us part I guess!",
"agony - In James Wan's Saw (2004), Jigsaw forces his victims to put themselves through extreme agony in order to be release from their grisly contraption. Many of the scary scenes were inspired by Wan's and cowriter Leigh Whannell's nightmares from when they were kids. Now that's a dream come true!",
"dusty - Abandoned houses are usually extremely dusty... and haunted. One prime example is the titular character's house in 'The Woman in Black' (2012). In addition to being dusty, the house is filled with cute/creepy mechanical toys and music boxes. These props were real life antiques on loan from a collecter. The dust was also real as the house was an avid dust collecter.",
"bates - Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates in 'Psycho' (1960). Perkins would reprise this role in 'Pycho II' (1983). The original showerhead in the first film was also supposed to reprise its role in the sequel, but was stolen just before filming began. Literally a stolen opportunity!",
"karma - Karma seems to be prevalent in horror movies; particularly 'bad karma' in the form of slasher rules. Characters doing 'bad things' such as having sex, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, etc. always meet an untimely demise. In a way, many slasher victims 'had it coming'. Sounds like a religious agenda to me!",
"gouge - The eye gouge is a popular move in the horror world. In 'The Evil Dead' (1981), Ash uses it to great effect against his possessed friend, Scott. In '28 Days Later' (2002), protagonist Jim uses it to take main solider baddie, Major Henry West. Even baddies use it such as in 1982s 'Friday the 13th Part III' when Jason expertly shoots an arrow into one of his victim's eyes. There are many different uses of the eye gouge, but they all have one thing in common- no one sees it coming!",
"phone - 'We traced the call. It's coming from inside the house!' Horror nerds will recognize this line as the major plot point for 'When a Stranger Calls' (1979), but we all know the first movie to use this chilling line was 'Black Christmas' (1974). The two films are so close in that plot point that some fans theorize that the killer from both films are one in the same and therefore exist in the same world. 'Phone Call Cinematic Universe', anyone?",
"danny - The child actor that plays Danny Torrence in 'The Shining' (1980) is also named Danny; surname Lloyd. Director Stanley Kubrick had soft spot for Lloyd and so he hid the fact that they were filming a horror movie from him. From Lloyd's point of view, they were filming a drama. He didn't find out the truth until several years after filming when he finally saw the movie, albeit a heavily edited version.  Lloyd was 17 years old when he finally saw an uncut version.",
"faery - In Guillermo del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth' (2006), two faeries end up getting eaten by the Pale Man due to protagonist Ohpelia's disobedience. The Pale Man chases her shortly after. During a screening of the film in which Del Toro sat next to Stephen King, Del Toro observed King squirming in his seat during this chase scene. Del Toro says seeing this reaction was like winning an Oscar.",
"myers - Michael Myers is the antagonist of John Carpenter's 'Halloween' (1978). Myers actually gets his name from the studio head of Miracle Films. Carpenter wanted to pay tribute to Myers for distributing his first, 'Assault On Precinct 13' (1977). Halloween day was never the same in the Myers' household...",
"offed - Past tense of 'off' as in to kill or murder. In horror movies, someone's gotta get offed, right? Wrong. From horror classics such as 'Freaks' (1932) and 'The Amityville Horror' (1979) to the modern such as 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) and 'The Babadook' (2014), there are many great horror movies that don't include anyone biting the dust.",
"abyss - A group of adventurous woman take a trip into the abyss in 2005s 'The Descent'. Eventually they are trapped in the cave they are exploring and encounter deadly subterranean creatures known as 'crawlers'. These crawlers were designed to resemble Count Orlok from 'Nosferatu' (1922). However, the appearance of the crawlers was kept secret from the actors until they filmed the scene of the first encounter. When the actors finally saw the crawlers they all ran off the set genuinely scared.",
"doomy - The prescence of dead animals always provides a doomy atmosphere. Jordan Peele uses this to great affect in his first horror film, 'Get Out' (2017), in the scene where the main characters hit a deer while driving. A dead deer is meant to symbolize the loss of innocence. But in some states, it might mean the loss of your driver's license!",
"laura - 'Eyes of Laura Mars' (1978) is an American giallo film written by John Carpenter and was his first major studio film. Originally Barbra Streisand was originally attached play the titular role, but the role instead went to Faye Dunaway. Streisand sings the theme song 'Prisoner'; this would be the only song she sings for a movie in which she does not appear in.",
"porno - 'Porno' (2019), equipped with a slightly misleading title, is a film about 5 Christian teens accidentally releasing a deadly succubus in their local movie theater. In response to the question 'What do you want the audience to take away?', the director, Keola Racela, said: 'I hope they laugh. I hope we get in a few good scares too.' There goes any confirmation of whether it's pro or anti religious!",
"teeth - The plot of 'Teeth' (2007) revolves around a young lady, Dawn, having vagina dentata, or toothed vagina. This allows her to fight back when being assualted by horrible men. However, during the end credits there is a statement that reads: 'No man was harmed in the making of this film.' Disappointed!",
"penis - Horror is one of the genres where you are more likely to see male genitalia. But times have changed and the prevelance of full frontal male nudity is on the rise. This is due to less strict ratings on streaming platforms and writers and directors wanting to level the playing field in relation to the sexploitation of woman's bodies. But horror remains the leader in lost weinersnitchels.",
"board - As in Ouija board. Quija boards play a big role in connecting the natural and supernatural worlds together, such as in 1973s 'The Exorcist'. 12-year-old Regan plays with a Quija board and accidentally befriends international demon Pazuzu, allowing him to possess her. Whatever happened to good ol' Monopoly!",
"misty - Misty atmosphere always sets the tone on a haunted night, such as in Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' music video. John Landis directed this music video and also directed 'An American Werewolf in London' (1981) a few years prior. Due to this the two are connected in many ways. Landis uses the same make-up and special effects for both, and the were-tranformation sounds are the same. The score used in 'Thriller' was originally intended for 'An American Werewolf in London'. You can almost say this was a sidequel!",
"erica - 'Erica' (2019) is a fully filmed interactive horror mystery thriller game. The plot revolves around a young woman, Erica Mason, grappling with nightmares from her childhood and trying to unravel the truth of her family's occult past.",
"bared - In horror movies, we know that those who have bared all also lose all... of their life. 'The Cabin in the Woods' (2011) takes this trope to heart. It features the classic slasher archetypes: the whore, the athlete, the scholar, the fool and the virgin. Sticking to the script, as soona as 'the whore' bares all, she is killed shortly after. And we barely go to know her!",
"peter - Peter Weyland sends a team of scientists in search for the key to life in 2012s 'Prometheus'. Director Ridley Scott asked the design team to not rely too much on H.R. Giger's original designs from 'Alien' (1979). As they worked however, their drawings subconciously contained 'Gigeresque embellishments'. So they decided to bring Giger onboard to consult with the designs.",
"willy - Nicolas Cage stars in 'Willy's Wonderland' (2021). Cage plays a mysterious drifter that ends up having to spend a whole day in an abandoned Chucky-E-Cheese-esque restaurant that houses deadly animatronics. Though there are many similarities, the movie is not an adaptation of the 'Five Nights at Freddie's' video game. The director, Kevin Lewis, describes the movie as 'Pale Rider' (1985) vs 'Killer Klowns from Outer Space' (1988). Well whoop-de roddam de-doo!",
