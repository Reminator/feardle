[
"knife - In 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974), Gunnar Hansen, the actor who plays Leatherface, actually slices Marilyn Burns' finger with a knife in the dinner scene. This was out of frustration as the blood tube kept clogging during several takes.",
"cults - Real life cults often inspire horror films; such as 2015s 'The Invitation'. The movie takes inspiration from the cult, Peoples Temple, led by Jim Jones.",
"jason - Happy Friday the 13th!",
"chase - 'The Shining' (1980) was one of the first movies to use Steadicam. Most notably used in the hedge maze chase scene at the film's climatic end.",
"bones - Speaking of bones - Linda Blair fractured her lower spine while filming 'The Exorcist' (1973). She was injured by the mechanical rig attached to the bed she was thrown around in. We watch this in the movie because everybody thought it was just great acting!",
"licks - Freddie Kruger's tongue almost licks Nancy during the famous 'Tongue Telephone' scene in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (1984). The actress who played Nancy reportedly asked to take the tongue prop home after shooting.",
"dream - The premise of the film 'It Follows' (2014) is based on the director's recurring dream in which he was being followed. Keir Gilchrist, who starred in the film, has said that the director wanted the film to feel like a bad dream that never ends.",
"craft - As in 'The Craft' (1996). Director Andrew Fleming followed the guidelines for a PG-13 rating, but a bunch of old crotchety men decided to give it an R rating because it contained teenage girls using witchcraft. Rude!",
"motel - There was once a real life Bate's Motel people could stay in along the CA-99 near Washington state. A huge horror nerd renamed his motel to Bate's Motel and would regularly put on costume parties. Unfortunately the motel was torn down in April of 2012. The hotel sign however remains intact.",
"hexed - In 1990s 'The Witches', the lead protagonist is hexed by the Grand High Witch, turning into a mouse. The scene occurs in a ballroom full of witches, many of whom were actually men in dresses. Who knew!?",
"scare - Love it or hate it, the 'Jump Scare' is a common trope in horror movies. Film historians say the first use of it is in 'Cat People' (1942) during the bus stop scene in which Alice is being stalked by Irena. Me-ow!",
"chord - The 'Jump Scare' is often accompanied by the 'Scare Chord'- a sudden and sharp sforzando of dissonance or sheer noise intended to jolt the audience. One notable use was at the end of 1980s 'Friday the 13th' when Jason's rotting corpse suddenly jumps out of the water and grabs final girl Alice. Yikes!",
"candy - Not including the 2021 'requel', 1992s 'Candyman' is the only horror movie to feature a black serial killer as it's villain.",
"cobra - 'Cult of the Cobra' (1955) was often shown after 'Revenge of the Creature' (1955) as a double creature feature in theaters. Looks like Mr. Gillman was in good cobra-ny!",
"groan - Zombies moan and groan. To portray realistic cannabalistic zombies in 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968), the filmakers had the zombie actors eating ham covered in chocolate syrup. Bone apple tee?",
"death - Death is inevitable both in life and horror movies. To this day, Vincent Price has the most on screen deaths out of any actor in a horror movie. He always paid the ultimate Price!",
"price - Happy Birthday to The Master of Horror, Vincent Price!",
"crate - From cursed objects to a live(undead?) vampire, crates often contain important plot devices in horror movies. In 1948s 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein', the comedic duo are in charge of a crate that contains Count Dracula, played by the late Bela Lugosi. Though Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula is arguably the most iconic, this movie marks the second and last time he plays Dracula.",
"jesse - Mark Patton plays protagonist Jesse Walsh in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge' (1985). This is the only film in the franchise in which the final girl is played by a male. Patton is considered the first male 'Scream Queen' for his portrayal of Jesse. Not that gender matters anymore!",
"ghost - One of the ghost occupants in '13 Ghosts' (1960) is a lion. This lion would go on to portray the Addams' house pet, Kitty Kat, in 'The Addams Family' (1964) TV show. I guess they got a lion's share of the spotlight!",
"bleed - Wesley Snipes plays the titular character in 1998s 'Blade'. In the movie, Deacon Frost bleeds Blade to complete a ritual that would turn himself into a vampire god. Apparently Jet Li was offered the role of Deacon Frost, but turned it down to do 'Lethal Weapon 4' (1998). I guess he didn't think the role in 'Blade' was 'the one'.",
"cliff - One of the most memorable scenes in Midsommar (2019) was the Ättestupa; the scene depicts two elders of Harga leaping off a cliff in ritual suicide, marking the end of their lifecycle. Ättestupa is a name given to several cliffs in Sweden, Norway and Iceland. According to folklore, these were sites of ritual senicide.",
"dimly - Dimly lit spaces are a staple to horror movies. Filmmakers utilize low key lighting to achieve this. Though in modern times this lighting technique is used in horror, thillers and dramas, low key lighting was a defining element of the 'noir' films of the '40s and '50s. It was used to achieve high contrasts between light and dark; in art it is called the 'chiaroscuro effect'. Bet you didn't know this was 'low key' an art lesson!",
"rabbi - In Jewish folklore, a rabbi, Judah Loew ben Bezalel, creates a golem to protect the Jewish people from antisemites; this story is depicted in the silent horror film 'The Golem' (1915). Some believe Mary Shelley borrowed elements from this folklore for her 1818 novel 'Frankenstein'.",
"donny - Donny Beals is one of the kids enchanted by antagonist Andre Linoge in Stephen King's miniseries, 'Storm of the Century' (1999). Actor Colm Feore, who plays Linoge, took it upon himself to befriend all the child actors so that they wouldn't actually be scared of him. How nice of him to try and Colm the kids!",
"final - Horror nerds are familiar with the word 'final'. 'Final girl', 'The Final Chapter' (even though it isn't), 'Final Destination' (even though it isn't). But have you heard of 'The Final' (2010)? The plot revolves around a group of high school outcasts who are being bullied. They decide to get revenge on the bullies by giving them their just desserts... in gruesome fashion. Talk about dulce 'dead' leche!",
"sense - We all know what happens to Bruce Willis' character at the end of M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' (1999). But did you know that Willis was contractually obligated to do the movie? After shutting down production of 'The Broadway Brawler' by firing the director, Willis owed Disney two movies. 'The Sixth Sense' was the first, and 'The Kid' (2000) was the second.",
"leper - Leper refers to someone affected with leprosy. It also means an outcast of society. Many a horror villains are lepers.",
"cheek - Hannibal Lecter's first act of cannibalism was that of consuming a butcher's cheek. He attacked the butcher for insulting his adoptive mother, Lady Murasaki. The biting of the cheek would later become Hannibal's signature attack. It's best not to make a 'tongue in cheek' remark to Hannibal!",
"breed - Clive Barker's 'Nightbreed' (1990) was not well received when it released, but has gained a cult following over the years. Barker has said that the studio butchered the film in the editing room and tried to market it as a standard slasher and has expressed wanting to find the original reels to release his version. Barker was able find the original material and in 2014 released the 'Barker Cut'.",
"fiery - Carrie, played by Sissy Spacek, brings her school down in fiery fury in 'Carrie' (1976). The hand that we see at the end of the film is actually Specek's hand. The director, Brian De Palma, insisted on getting a double, but Spacek maintained that she had to be the one to do it. In setting up the scene, the de Palma was uncomfortable about burying her so he had her husband do it. Till death do us part I guess!",
"agony - In James Wan's Saw (2004), Jigsaw forces his victims to put themselves through extreme agony in order to be release from their grisly contraption. Many of the scary scenes were inspired by Wan's and cowriter Leigh Whannell's nightmares from when they were kids. Talk about a dream come true!",
